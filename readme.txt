Prevent rewrite rule madeness.

== Description ==

This is a WordPress plugin to prevent rewrite rule madeness.

Occasionally, WordPress or a plugin would go crazy and write WP rewrite rules block into .htaccess again and again and again ultimately resulting in a bloated .htaccess and potentially 500 Internal Server Error.

In many cases, this plugin would prevent that. 

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the package, and upload `wordpress-stop-the-madness` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Changes ==

* 1.0: Initial release version
